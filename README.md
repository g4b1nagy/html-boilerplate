# html-boilerplate

HTML5 CSS3 valid boilerplate


### What's this? ###

html-boilerplate is a solid foundation for that new front-end project. It provides a basic file structure, and allows you to choose between Bootstrap / normalize.css while staying out of your way as much as possible.


### Why? ###

Because nobody should have to write this stuff.  
Not even me?  
Not even me!
